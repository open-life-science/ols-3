# Open Life Science 3

Welcome! This is the [third cohort of Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3) (OLS-3) program repository. 
This repository will be used for the issue tracker feature of GitHub. 
All the projects going through OLS-3 will use one issue to keep track of their progress during the program (see [projects and participants](https://openlifesci.org/ols-3/projects-participants/)).

## How to Work With Us

Each issue will provide details for a project currently going through OLS-3. 
Find out more about each project how you can get involved in the individual issues.
